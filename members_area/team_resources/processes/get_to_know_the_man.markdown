Supportability:

It is essential to be supportable when you are a member of men's team. Every man can say that he is supportable, but we all have our limits or times when we might "hide" out. Look at some of the suggestions below and see if any of these describe you.

1.  Making excuses when a commitment is missed.
2.  Not acknowledging a missed commitment.
3.  Showing up late for meetings.
4.  Not returning phone calls/emails.
5.  Not participating in the meeting.
6.  How will let the team know that you "Got it" when they have given support.
7.  How will you tell the team that you are not open to further support at this time?

It is ok to tell the team that you are not ready to address an issue at this time.
