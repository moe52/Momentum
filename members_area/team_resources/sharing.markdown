This is a list of discussion and/or sharing topics that range from the simple and mundane to some of the meaty questions you ponder.  The general idea is to learn about more about the men who make up your team and their lives.  This provides you more insight to an individual man and his personal experiences.  These topics/questions can be used in a variety of ways.  For example, your team may choose to select a particular question prior to the meeting and have each man take a few minutes in sharing their response with the team.  Or you may decide to have each man select one of his choosing and share with the team.  Possibilities are endless.
