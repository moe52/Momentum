**HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?** One or more team meetings

**WHY DO THIS?** Get a snapshot of team health, start a discussion that will push a team out of complacency

**WHAT SUPPORT IS NEEDED?** Hero or non-team member

**WHO CAN HELP?** Any hero

**WHAT IS THE TEAM'S ROLE?** Team Discussion

**WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?**

-   Is the energy level at the end of the meeting higher than at the beginning?

-   Are Men absent or late to meetings?

-   Is there a sense of intimacy?

-   Is the interaction open and honest?

-   Do the Men give honest feedback?

-   Does everyone participate at the meetings?

-   Do the Men give unsolicited advice?

-   Are the Men having fun?

-   Does the Team act with intention?

Does the Team takes it's own energy temperature and follows up on the results?
