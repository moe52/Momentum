## Momentum is for men

Our focus is on men’s work and being the best men we can be. 

## We support men to have authentic friendships

Sure, we like to have fun together, but we’re looking for something more: authentic, lifelong friendships with great men we trust, who become like brothers.

## Momentum supports teams

We believe that men benefit greatly from being on teams that meet regularly to support each other to live their values and achieve their dreams. 

## We are committed to growth

We challenge each other to be better men, and allow ourselves to be challenged. We are ruthless in our compassion. 

## Is this for you?

Come visit a monthly meeting or contact us.
It's a safe, trusted environment where men have authentic relationships with other men who support each others' journey through life. There is no religious or political affiliation. Most Owners are in the San Francisco Bay area, between San Jose and the mid-peninsula. Many men are on teams of 5-10 men who meet weekly. The organization meets monthly and sponsors a range of activities and online discussion groups.
