**HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?** Several team meetings

**WHY DO THIS?** Pursuit of understanding and intimacy

**WHAT SUPPORT IS NEEDED?** This list

**WHO CAN HELP?** A man who has worked through the 5 Languages of Love

**WHAT IS THE TEAM'S ROLE?** Desire to be effective in how they show up in a loving relationship

**WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?**

This material was first introduced by a women's support group who had used it and found it very helpful. It may not be absolutely empirically proven, but the concepts are helpful and highly predictive. The book, 5 Languages of Love, there is certainly enough meat in there for a segment in 5 or more team meetings where an hour or so at each team meeting is devoted to this process. <http://www.5lovelanguages.com/>

The team can work with the basic concept in several ways, so team leader might want to organize a series of team meetings around the following themes:

1.  Getting familiar with the 5 different languages of loves and being readily familiar with practical examples of each language--- this can take several weeks depending on how deep the team wants to go. The languages of love are:
    1.  Physical touch including non sexual touch as well as sexual touch
    2.  Quality Time physical presence including companionship, listening, romantic quality time
    3.  Gift Giving including monetary support
    4.  Words of affirmation and appreciation including saying "I love you" verbally, with all its variations
    5.  Acts of service and acts of loving support
2.  Helping men identify and rank their own natural preferences around communicating love to others, esp. their partner and children.
3.  Helping the men recognize their own needs for receiving demonstrations of love from others (and distinguishing how to do so within different relationships: partner, children and co-workers).
4.  Helping men identify and rank their primary partner's natural preferences around receiving communications of love from them.
5.  Helping men develop strategies to shift their behavior to align their loving demonstrations with their beloved's desires/preferences.
6.  Helping men develop support to be successful in learning to read and interpret their partner's loving expression of love towards them.

**Detailed Activities**
