**HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?** About one team meeting per member

**WHY DO THIS?** Building intimacy, understanding history

**WHAT SUPPORT IS NEEDED?** The team may be able to make it meaningful on their own, or may need a hero to model the type of questioning that works best.

**WHO CAN HELP?** NA, team process

**WHAT IS THE TEAM'S ROLE?** Ask questions to deepen understanding. Do not give advice and avoid asking questions leading to problem solving

**WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?**

The process is stated very simply -- "Tell me about your father". The team leader selects one man per night. It is good to announce the man a week ahead of time, in case he wants to prepare some visual aids. The man can be as deep as he wants.
