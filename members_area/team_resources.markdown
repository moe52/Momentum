One of the things that makes Momentum unique are the experiences we all share together at our monthly general meetings, or as an active participant in our teams, or some other activity.  Below is an evolving list of resources to use in providing ways to enrich your team’s experience in further building our strength in the Momentum community.

**Resources are categorized into five major headings.**

* [Team Activities & Excursions](/members_area/activities/)  


* [Team / Individual Sharing](/members_area/sharing/)  


* [Team Discussion](/members_area/discussion/)

Had a new team experience/activity you’d think would benefit other teams?  Please contact your team's Hero and we’ll be glad to review it with you and if possible share for other teams to enjoy.  Remember, our success as an organization relies on your contributions to help us all grow to be better stronger men.  So, you are an integral part of that success.
