**HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?** One team meeting per member

**WHY DO THIS?** To learn how much esteem each team member has for the others

**WHAT SUPPORT IS NEEDED?** None, but might be good to have hero help the first week

**WHO CAN HELP?** NA, team discussion

**WHAT IS THE TEAM'S ROLE?** Ability to differentiate and talk about a man as if he is not there

**WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?**

The process can take 30-60 minutes for each man.

The team leader 'kills' a man each week. The dead man can take notes but he cannot speak or communicate in any way, since he is dead. The other team members have a free discussion about the man now that he is gone. Who was he? What did you like/not like about the man? What is his legacy? What did he leave undone?

The man can take notes about what he's hearing and feeling.

The team leader raises him from the dead. The man states what he heard, how he feels and addresses anything he either disagrees with or wants to correct. The team can redirect him if what he heard is not what was said.

This process can be paired with Turds in the Punch Bowl. Eulogy goes first, followed by Turds.
