_The Four Pillars of Successful Teams_


1. **Teams create a safe space for men to be vulnerable and visible to their teammates**

   Creating a safe space builds the trust and confidence men need to be open. As men begin to open they develop insight and self-understanding, at which point the team is there to support them to become the men they would like to be. Offering honest feedback also requires vulnerability when feelings arising out of hearing a share make others uncomfortable.

   Most teams meet weekly for 2-3 hours, where meetings are conducted with respect for the time and priorities of each member. Teams should [develop a charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaXbDPUiFpaRgzoDIWzkusm7hFTY406AJ6w1VtTMzZM) to guide team direction over time. Confidentiality is an absolute requirement, as it enables deeper trust and sharing as men know that their teammates will hold their words in confidence.

2. **Teams are connected to the larger community**

   Cross-pollination with the greater Momentum circle is a central component of vibrant, healthy teams. Connected teams encourage men to attend [General Meetings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17BNZlBWdr2OoJBO8rlS4Vf6J_KP_9-71Rk2cFwcoCe4/edit#gid=103022674&range=66:66) and the  [Fall Event](https://gomomentum.org/going-deeper-fall-event/), and they encourage members to undergo some form of Momentum initiation such as [Expedition](https://discourse.gomomentum.org/t/expedition-a-major-new-momentum-initiative/3734), [NoMQuest](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17BNZlBWdr2OoJBO8rlS4Vf6J_KP_9-71Rk2cFwcoCe4/edit#gid=103022674&range=130:130), or [Stroke 4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17BNZlBWdr2OoJBO8rlS4Vf6J_KP_9-71Rk2cFwcoCe4/edit#gid=103022674&range=171:171). The team welcomes envoys such as Heroes and the Edge Process, which intend to challenge, broaden, and enrich a team's perspective.

3. **Teams are Owners of Momentum**

   Owners support the larger community as leaders, are [current with dues](https://gomomentum.org/join/), contribute to [Tempo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3Wz6EpgEh1O3ZbjZpbxSQjz9Mo4-r9xVPXfOdcdyDw/edit)[1], and periodically step up to lead Momentum functions such as the [Fall Event](https://gomomentum.org/going-deeper-fall-event/), [Hero Teams](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17BNZlBWdr2OoJBO8rlS4Vf6J_KP_9-71Rk2cFwcoCe4/edit#gid=103022674&range=78:78), along with leadership roles such as Momentum Chief, Tempo Chief, New Owners Chief, Treasurer.

4. **Teams support new men becoming Owners**

   Teams support incoming new men by, for example:[2]
   a) Sending a man to visit a [Launchpad](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrEpNpA2veLOTX_c18QoaLXJploijRxIQT54FXJOZuY) meeting,
   b) Hosting a [Rotator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17BNZlBWdr2OoJBO8rlS4Vf6J_KP_9-71Rk2cFwcoCe4/edit#gid=103022674&range=145:145), or
   c) Hosting a [Team Visit](https://www.meetup.com/GoMomentum-Pen/events/238747040/).
