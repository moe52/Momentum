HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? 1-2 hours per man, generally one man per meeting

WHY DO THIS? Help all men on a team to know each other better

SUGGESTED FACILITATORS: NA – team function

WHAT IS THE TEAM’S ROLE? Engaging the man by asking clarifying questions and listening attentively. The goal is intimacy/connection.

WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?

One man is selected to present his life story, in considerable detail, with photos, memorabilia, slides, or whatever the man feels he needs to tell his story. Stories should go beyond the simple facts to talk about what happened, why it happened, and how it made the man who he is today.
